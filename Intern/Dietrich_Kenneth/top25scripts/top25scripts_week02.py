Research of scripts
so far I could find 9 scripts that I thought were worth choosing for the end of
this week.
1) http://www.creativecrash.com/maya/downloads/scripts-plugins/dynamics/c/detachparticles
Detatches particles, could be useful.

2) http://www.creativecrash.com/maya/downloads/scripts-plugins/dynamics/c/particlesfromocean-v--2
Splashes from an ocean, quality isn't that great... but could work out for low end splashes

3) http://www.creativecrash.com/maya/downloads/scripts-plugins/dynamics/c/bt_fluidshadedparticles-mel
A particle shader that helps make particles look like smoke... could be top five.

4) http://www.creativecrash.com/maya/downloads/scripts-plugins/dynamics/c/texture2particles
This texturizer for particles looks pretty good... and could make it to top five.

5) http://www.creativecrash.com/maya/downloads/scripts-plugins/dynamics/c/oceansplash--2
Oceansplash, it's okay.
6) http://www.creativecrash.com/maya/downloads/shaders/c/ed-lava-flow
Lava.

7) http://www.creativecrash.com/maya/downloads/scripts-plugins/dynamics/c/zkyagefield
The age field for particles... why isn't this include with Maya? It is in every other
3d package that I can think of and is pretty amazing and useful.

8) http://www.creativecrash.com/downloads/3d-models/geography/c/wave-pro-1-5--2
This script creates the surfs up wave.. not as good, but it works pretty
close to what they did.

9) http://www.creativecrash.com/maya/downloads/scripts-plugins/dynamics/c/emfxclouds-cloud-generator
So far this one is the best. It creates clouds that a person can have a camera
fly through. The quality is amazing and will be researching into this one the most.
