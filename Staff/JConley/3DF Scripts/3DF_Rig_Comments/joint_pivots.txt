A
Your joints were placed in a way that correlates to the movement of the geometry in an appropriate manner.
F
Your joints are not place in a way that correlates to the movement of the geometry.
Straight Joints
The joints are too straight. There should be a slight bend, or a stronger one in the knee or arm to allow for better movement.
Back Placement
The back pivot points are set up incorrectly, which is causing the spine to behave abnormally. The joints should be placed from where the corresponding geometry should move.
Overlap in Back
The pivot placement for the back could have been better. When animating the rig into a back bend, the geometry overlaps. This could have been corrected by drawing the spine joints closer to the back geometry. Right now the bones are too central.
