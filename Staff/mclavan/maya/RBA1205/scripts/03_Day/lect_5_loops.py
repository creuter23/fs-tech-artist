Lecture 5 - Logic

Description:
    Lecture 5 main focus is learning how to do different logic techniques such as
        if statments and loops to build better tools
    Students will learn how to use if statments to alter their tools depending upon a users actions.
    Students will also learn how to use loops along with functions to automate tasks.
    The overall point of this lecture is to learn how to make their scripts more robust and save time.
    
    Topics Convered:
        - IF statments
        - error handeling
        - loops
        - renaming
        - lock and hide
        
    What should I know after looking at this script?
        - How to loop through an entire list using a for-in loop.
        - How to rename each object in a loop.
        
    Questions you should ask yourself:
        - How does a for-in loop know how many times to loop?
        - How does the xrange and for-in loop differ?

Loops
The class book has a dedicated chapter just to loops (Chapter 4)
'''

'''
for-in loop
Loop through each element in a list.
'''

'''
xrange loop
Loop a fixed amount of time.
