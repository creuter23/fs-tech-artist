Lecture 4 - List

Description:
    Lecture 4 consists of developing basic tools.
    Students will learn how to research and convert commands into python.
    Students will also learn how to break down complex system and replicate them in code.
    Topics Covered:
        - Variables
        - Lists *
        - Maya Command Anatomy
        - Automating systems
        - Functions args and returns statment
        
    What should I know after looking at this script?
        - How to create a list.
        - How to access individual elements of a list?
        
    Questions you should ask yourself:
        - Why do I need a list?  Why do I just create individual variables?
        - What does the len command do?

Storing multile pieces of data.

# Creating a list of names
names = ['Michael', 'George', 'Susan']  # A list with a lenght of 3
print names

# Individual access (index)

# index        0          1         2       (Index number represent individual list data)
# names = ['Michael', 'George', 'Susan']
print names[0]  # Results 'Michael'
print names[2]  # Results 'Susan'
print names[-1] # Results 'Susan  (Access backwards through negative numbers)

# len command
# returns the total length of a list
print len(names) # Length will be 3.
