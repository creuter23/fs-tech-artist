Idea:
Automate setting up a control icon.
'''

# I'd like to be able to match a joints orientation onto a control icon, by 
# selecting the joint and then the control icon.

'''
Break down the concept.
- Do it in the interface, watch the script editor and take notes on the process.
'''

# Write comments for each step.

# 1) User selected joint then icon
# 	- That means I'm going to have to get selected.
# 2) Control is point and orient constraint to joint
#	- To match orientations
# 3) Constraints are deleted
#	- Because they were only used to match orientations.
