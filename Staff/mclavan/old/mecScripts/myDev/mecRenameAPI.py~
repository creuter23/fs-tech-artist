Description:
	- This renaming script is different because it uses Maya's API to grab 
	  directly access the names of the objects.  So, it doesn't matter 
	  which heirarchy they belong to it still will stay connected.

How To Run:

import mecRenameAPI
mecRenameAPI.gui()

Debug:
import mecRenameAPI
reload(mecRenameAPI)
mecRenameAPI.gui()
'''

print( "mecRenameAPI imported" )

import maya.cmds as cmds
import maya.OpenMaya as om
