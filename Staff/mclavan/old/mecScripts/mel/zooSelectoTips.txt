Selecto lets you create selection triggers - called "Selectos" in your viewport.  They float above the actual character so they're easy to pick, and they can be made transparent so they don't obscure the view of your character
Selectos are easy to make - simply select the objects you want to create selectos for, go to the "create" tab of the Selecto Author tool, and press the "build selectos" button
When you create selectos, by default the tool makes a circle the same colour as the wireframe of the object its selecting.  If you want them a different shape, simply right click on the "shape" area in the create tab, and choose which shape you'd prefer.||To change the colour, right click on additional options, and choose a colour from the colour sub-menu
You can setup a marking menu to give you really fast access to many of the selecto functions.  By default it functions as a hotkey to toggle the selectos on and off.  But hold it down, and the marking menu gives you access to changing cameras, hiding/unhiding character selectos, changing transparency etc...
To setup the marking menu, in the Author Selecto window, go to Help->Setup Hotkey
Selecto uses a script called zooTriggered.  If you have a zooTriggered shelf button installed, it looks like a green or grey "glass-like" button.  When this button is green the script is turned on, when it is grey, the script is off.||When you want to change the size of a selecto, zooTriggered must be turned off.  This allows you to select the actual selecto.  Going into the create tab automatically turns zooTriggered off
